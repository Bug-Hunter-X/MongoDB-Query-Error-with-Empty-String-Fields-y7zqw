# MongoDB Query Error with Empty String Fields

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using empty strings in MongoDB queries.  The issue arises when the MongoDB driver doesn't handle empty strings consistently across various versions and scenarios, leading to unexpected errors or incorrect query results.  This example focuses on JavaScript but the principle applies to other drivers.

## Problem

Empty strings in query filters can cause the driver to throw errors or fail to retrieve the expected results.  The behavior is not always consistent and can depend on the specific MongoDB version, driver version, and the structure of your query.

## Solution

The best practice is to explicitly handle empty string cases within your application logic before constructing the MongoDB query. This avoids sending potentially problematic queries to the database.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and a MongoDB instance running.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `node bug.js` (This will likely throw an error, demonstrating the problem)
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` (This demonstrates the solution by handling empty strings correctly)
